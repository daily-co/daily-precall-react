This repository demonstrates how to create a precall experience using the [Daily Client SDK for Javascript](https://docs.daily.co/guides/products/client-sdk) and [Daily React](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-react).
A good precall experience where users can check their devices and test their network conditions is a great way to proactively tackle any potential in-call issues.

# How to install

We recommend you [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), so you can use it as a starting point for your own precall experience.

```bash
# clone repo (replace url with the location of your fork)
git clone git@github.com:daily-co/daily-precall-react.git

# go to root folder
cd daily-precall-react

# install dependencies
yarn install

# run the app
yarn dev

# build the app
yarn build
```

# How to use

Once you've followed the installation steps, you can run `yarn dev` to get the repo up and running.

The starterkit can be found on `http://127.0.0.1:5174/` -- note that the port might change depending on any other processes you have running.

We use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for development and building.
